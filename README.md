# Hangman-Game-Website

- This website allows the user to play Hangman. The user can view the rules on the homepage by clicking the "Rules" button, and play the game 
by clicking "Start Game." A word from an open-source API is fetched and the user begins guessing letters! As the user guesses letter, the
guessed letter disappears from the screen's view to signal to the user that they cannot guess that same letter anymore. Users can also only
guess letters as no word will contain any other character.

- This website also is optimized for use on a laptop or monitor that is sized about 24 inches. A different size or shaped screen might result
  in a slightly off-looking view for the user where the user might have to zoom-in or zoom-out to find a view that is comfortable for them.

- Fork the code from the provided Repl link, and then open the website in a new tab to view it.
